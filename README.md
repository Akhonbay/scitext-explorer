Preprocessing:

Stopwords: Stopwords are common, filler words (such as a, an, the) that are found across    most documents.

Remove punctuation: Remove punctuation that may be filtered in along with the words.

Word Stemming: Removes affixes of words in order to get the root word (i.e. "jumping", "jumper", "jumped" all turns into to "jump).

Word Lemmatization: Reduces different forms of words down to the base word (i.e. "sing", "sang", and "sung" all turn into "sing").
